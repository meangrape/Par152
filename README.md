Par 1.52
======== 

[Par](http://www.nicemice.net/par/) is a text formatter written by Adam M. Costello.

I use it with [vim](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Par_text_reformatter).

In the past, I've gone to Adam's site and downloaded `par`, building it manually. 

Here I've collected a patch that supplies `autoconf` functionality by [Nelson H. F. Beebee](http://www.math.utah.edu/~beebe/)
as well as a patch by Jérôme Pouiller that handles multibyte characters.

I haven't added any new functionality, this is just a matter of convenience for me.

You do the standard ./configure; make; make install dance.
